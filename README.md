## [Git vs. GitHub](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b777MzxqxIpTITSXiPOdn9427Oo7VclwecAiZ-5boy8/edit#slide=id.ge18f0c268_0_15)
[Git](https://git-scm.com/docs) is a **verison control** system that keeps track of all the verisons(saves) in a file, and helps manange and organizes it.  

[Github](https://github.com/) is where you store all your files on a cloud, into a remote server, where it keeps track of the file, and allows anyone else to view and copy your file.

Git is used to help move files into or out of Github. Git tracks file verisons and files of all the changes you have mad overtime, while Github is just a open storage space for many different lamguauges of code.

## Initial Setup
1. First open your Github
1. Then click on your icon in the top right, make sure you see the drop down menu
1. Click on settings
1. Once in settings click on SSH and GPG keys.
1. Click on add new SSH key
1. Name it "** c9 - 'Name' "  ***(Dont close the page)***
1. Now open your _**c9**_ and log in
2. Click on the gear icon in the top right
2. Click on SSH Keys and copy and the 2nd SSH key on the bottom "Connect to your private git repository Add this key to authorized keys list on your code hosting service (gitlab/github/bitbucket etc.)"
3. Paste it to your key section in the Github page that you still have open.

#### Congrats your are done setting up your SSH key, and are ready to link and push to Github!

## Repository Setup
* "**Git init**" stands for git initize. It helps initize the folder/repository so that other git commands, like "**git add**", "git commit**", and "**git remote**".  
* There are 3 parts to the git project, working directory, staging area, and repository.  
* The working directory is where you will type the codes.  
* The staging area is where you will prepare all the files to send them to the repository/cloud in Github.  
* You add codes to the staging area with "**git add**".  
* Once the desired files are added, you do "**git commit -m 'message'**" afterwards, then the files is commited and saved. 
* "**Git commit -m 'message'**" creates a verion of the git file and you can rollback to it if anything unexpected happens to the current verison.

Additionally if you want to "**git push**" it to github, you need to link the SSH and create a github repository with the same name as the c9 file.

## [Workflow & Commands](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1b777MzxqxIpTITSXiPOdn9427Oo7VclwecAiZ-5boy8/edit#slide=id.ge18f0c268_0_31)

"**Git status**" checks all the changes so made so far on your cloud, and if you have "added them".  
```
jeffreyg2240:~/workspace/github-tutorial (master) $ git status
On branch master
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

"**Git add**" adds the file into the staging area to be commited.  
* "**Git add --all**" adds unadded files to the staging area.
```
$ git add --all
```
* "**Git add 'name'**" adds the a un-added file to the staging area, you choose which file.
```
$ git add "README.MD"
```
* "**Git add .**" adds the current file you are in into the staging area.  
``` 
$ git add .
```
"**Git commit -m 'message'**", moves the staging area to repository, and it creates a verison that you can rollback to later. The message you leave on "git commit" is a self reminder of what you last were working on, or a note to self.
```
$ git commit -m "added a explaination of git commit"
```
["**Git remote add origin URL**"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DcOm1hZQTgsJYxqCE5na8zEAhlyh_Z0V4ivtt8aAsf0/edit#slide=id.g3ad02a1f9_010), connects your current project file to a repository on c9.
* remote sets up an connection between github and your c9 account.
* add, adds a new bridge.
* origin, can be any name, origin is just a name for the bridge, remote you are making, it can be renamed to anything.
* URL, you this this from your github everytime you make a new repository, copy the SSH, URL and paste it in place of the "**URL**"
["**Git push -u origin master**"](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DcOm1hZQTgsJYxqCE5na8zEAhlyh_Z0V4ivtt8aAsf0/edit#slide=id.ge239e83e1_0_10) 
* Push, pushes the project to github, but it requires a bridge and direction to which branch.
* -u helps remember which branch and repo you last pushed it to, so you can just type "**git push**" next time
* origin, must be the same name you named the bridge, remote, in "**Git remote add origin URL**".
* master, the _**default** main branch_, unless manually changed.

## [Rolling Back Changes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yBhhaSNtHEC4Sqc-jMxeMMqPeNOT7zVuiOU_e5eWV_8/edit#slide=id.g25a990f774_1_10)

[Rollback](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yBhhaSNtHEC4Sqc-jMxeMMqPeNOT7zVuiOU_e5eWV_8/edit#slide=id.g192aa2692a_0_0) is a way to undo what you previously did.  
You can rollback to your previous **edit**,  "**git add**", "**git commit**", and "**git push**".
* "**Git checkout --filename**", it reverts to last time the file was added to stage
* "**Git reset HEAD filename**", it removes a file from stage.
* "**Git reset HEAD~1**", it removes takes 2 steps back and does the same as "**Git reset --easy HEAD~1**" and "**Git checkout --filename**", it moves the file from repository to working directory.
* "**Git reset --easy HEAD~1**", it uncommits the file and removes it from repository
* "**Git reset --hard HEAD~1**" it uncommits the file and removes it from staging area and it moves the file from repository in github to working directory.
